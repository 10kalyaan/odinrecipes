    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you're looking for a homemade pizza crust recipe that's great for beginners, you're in luck. This top-rated
        recipe is
        super easy to throw together on a whim – and it puts the store-bought stuff to shame.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast: Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to
            rise.</li>
        <li>Sugar: To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar
            gives the yeast
            something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes
            bubbly and
            frothy on top.</li>
        <li>Bread Flour: Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour.
            This is because it
            contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and
            flavor, but it creates a
            barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
        <li>Salt: A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier
            crust), and slows
            down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make Pizza Dough step-by-step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature: After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to
            rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will
            allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</li>
        <li>Prepare Your Surface With Oil: You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to
            prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Shape the Dough: You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a
            rolling pin, or pat it with your
            hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough.</li>
        <li>When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick.
            If you get
            too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl
        tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature
        before
        using.</p>
